;; A probe for the limitation this library works around, so that nobody has to
;; remember it.
;;
;; `kotoba/pattern_core.kotoba` has `main` return a constant. It would rather
;; call the machine -- an entry that exercises what the module does is worth
;; more than one returning 0 -- but a `main` that calls `match-end-at` makes
;; the compiler refuse the whole module:
;;
;;   {:error :value, :code :kotoba/internal-error,
;;    :message "value is not a boolean"}
;;
;; at the :value phase, where the compile-time evaluator runs the entry.
;; `kotoba -M check` passes, the same module compiles for the JS backend, and
;; the emitted machine answers correctly (216/216 against the host's RegExp).
;; Raising --fuel does not change it. Measured 2026-09-09, deterministic.
;;
;; The probe rebuilds that failing form FROM the current source, so it cannot
;; drift, and it FAILS THE DAY THE COMPILER STOPS REFUSING IT -- at which point
;; the workaround should be removed rather than inherited.
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 the limitation is still there, 1 it is gone (act on it),
;; 2 REFUSED.
